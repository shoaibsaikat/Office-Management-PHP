# Office-Management-PHP
This Office management app is different from the other version that I've made. Made only using raw PHP in mind, no UI framework will be added to this app except jQuery.

Features:
1. User profile management.
2. Leave management.

Notes:
1. Token system is used only for user manager and password change. It's just used to check a new style of authorization, but not used elsewhere. But can be included in other DB calls.
2. Still work in progress.
3. DB example file is "inventory_php_test.sql".
